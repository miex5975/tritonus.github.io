        <h1> Tenerife Sea</h1>
        <h2> Lyrics </h2>
	<p>You look so wonderful in your dress<br>
I love your hair like that<br>
The way it falls on the side of your neck<br>
Down your shoulders and back<br>
We are surrounded by all of these lies<br>
And people that talk too much<br>
You got that kind of look in your eyes<br>
As if no one knows anything but us<br><br>
Should this be the last thing I see

I want you to know
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need<br>
I'm so in love<br>
So in love<br>
So in love<br>
So in love<br>
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
So in love
So in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you, Beth
        </p>
