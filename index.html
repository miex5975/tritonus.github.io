	    <h1> Why I should get a tortoise! </h1>
	    <h3> 1. A tortoise is a friend for life.</h3>
	    <p> A totoise lives for about as long as a human-being. It means he or she will be a lifelong friend.</p>
	    <h3> 2. I will learn how to take care of others.</h3>
	    <p> To take care of someone is an important thing to learn. And because I necessarily don't like humans a 
		    pet teaches me how to take care of others.</h3>
