        <h1> Tenerife Sea</h1>
        <h2> Lyrics </h2>
	<p>You look so wonderful in your dress<br>
I love your hair like that<br>
The way it falls on the side of your neck<br>
Down your shoulders and back<br>
We are surrounded by all of these lies<br>
And people that talk too much<br>
You got that kind of look in your eyes<br>
As if no one knows anything but us<br><br>
Should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need<br><br>
I'm so in love<br>
So in love<br>
So in love<br>
So in love<br><br>
You look so beautiful in this light<br>
Your silhouette over me<br>
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes<br>
Is the Tenerife sea<br>
And all of the voices surrounding us here<br>
They just fade out when you take a breath<br>
Just say the word and I will disappear<br>
Into the wilderness<br><br>
Should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need<br><br>
I'm so in love<br>
So in love<br>
So in love<br>
So in love<br><br>
Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me<br>
Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me<br>
Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me<br><br>
Should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need<br><br>
So in love<br>
So in love<br>
So in love, love, love, love<br>
So in love<br><br>
You look so wonderful in your dress<br>
I love your hair like that<br>
And in the moment I knew you, Beth<br>
        </p>
